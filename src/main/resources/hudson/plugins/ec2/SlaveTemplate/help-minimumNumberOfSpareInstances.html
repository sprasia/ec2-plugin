<div>
    <p>Set a minimum number of spare instances to make available.</p>

    <p>The idea is that up to the instance cap, there will always be this number
    of instances unused and waiting for builds.</p>

   <p>This is different from the minimum number of instances, which only guarantees
    that n instances exist, not whether there is any available capacity.</p>

    <p>If this value is set 1, there will be one instance available, then if that
    instance is used by a build, another will be provisoned. The idea being that
    there is always a waiting instance ready for an incoming build. If you
    have a high rate of incoming builds this value can be set higher.</p>

   <p>Note that value is local to this specific AMI and associated configurations.</p>
